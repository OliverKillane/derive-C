/// Zero sized types are useful as markers (e.g. for gdb printing, or to replace debug info structs
// on release).
// - In gcc/clang C a struct with a zero sized array is itself zero sized.
// - In C++ this is not valid, and the type must be at least 1 byte. Hence for compatibility, zero
//   sized is size 1 in C++
